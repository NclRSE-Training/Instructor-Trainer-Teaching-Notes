This episode is a common place to Trainers to cut while preparing to teach.
That's not because this is not important -- this page is a valuable resource -- but we feel this
is one of the sections that trainees can use effectively as a resource when actually preparing
for a workshop, even without spending a lot of time doing activities on this material during
their Instructor Training event.
