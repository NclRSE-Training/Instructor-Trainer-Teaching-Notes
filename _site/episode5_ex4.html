    <h2>Mapping Cognitive Load</h2>
    <p>Look in the curriculum that you chose to prepare for this workshop and focus on one step or task that learners will be asked to complete.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What concepts will learners need to understand and hold in short-term memory in order to complete this task?</li>
  <li>Draw a concept map connecting these concepts. What relationships do learners need to understand to connect them?</li>
  <li>How many of these concepts and relationships have been introduced since the previous step or exercise?</li>
</ol>

<p>With a partner or in small groups, discuss what you have found. Are your learners at risk of cognitive overload at this point in your workshop? Why or why not?</p>

<p>This exercise should take about 15 minutes.</p>
