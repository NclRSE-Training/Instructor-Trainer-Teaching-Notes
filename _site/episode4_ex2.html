    <h2>Awareness Gaps</h2>
    <ol>
  <li>Is there anything you are learning how to do right now? Can you identify something that you still need to think about, but your teacher can do without thinking about it?</li>
  <li>Think about the area of expertise you identified for yourself earlier. What could a potential awareness gap be?</li>
</ol>

<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
