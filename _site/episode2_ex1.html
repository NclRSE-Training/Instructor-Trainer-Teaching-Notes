    <h2>Analogy Brainstorm</h2>
    <ol>
  <li>Think of an analogy to explore. Perhaps you have a favorite that relates to your area of professional interest, or a hobby. If you prefer to work with an example, consider this common analogy from education: “teaching is like gardening.”</li>
  <li>Share your analogy with a partner or group. (If you have not yet done so, be sure to take a moment to introduce yourself, first!) What does your analogy convey about the topic? How is it useful? In what ways is it wrong?</li>
</ol>

<p>This activity should take about 10 minutes.</p>
