    <h2>Pronouns and Names</h2>
    <p>Using correct names and pronouns (e.g. “she/her”) is important to setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to do quickly, so we recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop.</p>

<p>In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.</p>

<p>At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers, or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.</p>

<p>Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer not to share them. Do not force people to share their pronouns.</p>
