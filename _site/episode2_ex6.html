    <h2>Handling Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Formative assessments allow us as instructors to adapt our instruction to our audience. What options do we have if a majority of the class chooses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mostly one of the wrong answers?</li>
  <li>mostly the right answer?</li>
  <li>an even spread among options?</li>
</ol>

<p>Choose one of the above scenarios and compose a suggested response to it in the Etherpad.</p>

<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the majority of the class votes for a single wrong answer, you have a widespread misconception and can stop to examine and that misconception.</li>
<li>If most of the class votes for the right answer, it is ok to explain the answer and move on. Helpers can make themselves available to assist anyone who still feels uncertain.</li>
<li>If answers are pretty evenly split between options, learners may be guessing randomly, reflecting an absent mental model rather than a broken one. In this case it is a good idea to go back to a point where everyone was on the same page.</li>
</ol>
