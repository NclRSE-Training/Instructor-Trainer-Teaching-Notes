<ul>
   <li>If the child answers 32, they are throwing away the carry completely.</li>
   <li>If they answer 312, they know that they cannot just discard the carried ‘1’, but do not understand that it is actually a ten and needs to be added into the next column. In other words, they are treating each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.</li>
   <li>If they answer 33 then they know they have to carry the 1, but are carrying it back into the same column it came from.</li>
</ul>
