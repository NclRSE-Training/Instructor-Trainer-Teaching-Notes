Once upon a time, Carpentries workshops commonly used red and green sticky notes
because of their common symbolism for 'stop' and 'go.' However, we have learned
and grown! We strongly encourage you to get sticky notes in colors other than red and green (e.g. blue and yellow),
because learners, helpers, and Instructors with colorblindness may have difficulty
distinguishing red from green.
Some Instructors have also had great fun with differently-shaped sticky notes (stars and squares,
thumbs up that can be turned into thumbs down stickies etc.).
