Yesterday we asked you to read some resources about the logistics of teaching and running Carpentries workshops. Please
add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Etherpad. We will answer these questions in the Etherpad during your work time
and will return to this list later today.
This activity should take about 5 minutes.
