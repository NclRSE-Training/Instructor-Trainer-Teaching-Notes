In the Etherpad, share an example of words or notation that you sometimes use to accomplish or refer to the same thing.
If possible, try to think of an example that might occur in a Carpentries workshop.
Building awareness of how you can represent the same concept in multiple different ways
will help you avoid doing so without explanation while teaching.
This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
