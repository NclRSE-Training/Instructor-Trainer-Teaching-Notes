Select one role from the list below that interests you. Using the the descriptions on [The Carpentries community website][community-page], write
1) a short definition of the role and 2) a question that you have (or that you imagine someone else might have) about the role. Are there roles you
would like to see that are not listed? Note that, too!
This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
