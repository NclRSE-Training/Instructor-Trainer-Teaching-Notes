Using correct names and pronouns (e.g. 'she/her') is important to setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to
do quickly, so we recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop.

In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.

At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers, or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.

Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer not to share them.
Do not force people to share their pronouns.
