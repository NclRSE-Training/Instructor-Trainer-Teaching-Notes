title: "'Do You Understand?' is Ineffective as a Formative Assessment"

Learners are often reluctant to admit when they do not understand. Furthermore, self-assessments of skill in the absence of formative assessment are often inaccurate
because of the [Dunning-Kruger effect][Dunning]:
the less people know about a subject,
the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is. Therefore, if you ask a room full of people
'Do you understand?' the result will invariably be a number of 'yes' responses (many of them inaccurate) which tend to drown out a
variable amount of silence. Instead, a targeted formative assessment takes the inaccuracy and stress of self-judgement away and
demonstrates to all whether the learners' level of understanding has
met the instructor's goal.
