1. Take a moment to read through the Core Values on this page: <https://carpentries.org/values/>
2. Choose one core value that resonates with you. What is a decision you might make in a workshop
that could look different if you were actively considering the core value you chose?
This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

    <tr><td>

  <td>Always Learning: We value a growth mindset in all that we do and strive for continuous improvement, evolving ourselves and our methodologies, being responsive, curious, receptive to feedback, and eager to learn.<br/><img src="/assets/images/image004.png"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>
Inclusive of All: We advocate for inclusivity - welcoming and extending empathy and kindness - to leverage contributions from all community members, regardless of their identity or expression.<br/><img src="/assets/images/image005.png"></td>
  <td>People First: We believe that the individuals who make up our community are the most important part of our organisation and our strongest resource. We strive to make decisions that lower barriers for individual participation.<br/><img src="/assets/images/image006.png"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>
Access for All: We value accessibility as core, and create multiple avenues for participation where all people can learn and contribute.<br/><img src="/assets/images/image007.png"></td>
  <td>Community Collaboration: Our curricula and programs are developed by and with community members. We see collaboration across borders, domains and initiatives as a pathway to empower people and realise shared goals.<br/><img src="/assets/images/image008.png"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>
Strength through Diversity: Appreciating that identities are complex and individual, we believe in empowering a diverse group of people to work with data and code to answer the questions important to them and address challenges in science and society.<br/><img src="/assets/images/image009.png"></td><td></td>
