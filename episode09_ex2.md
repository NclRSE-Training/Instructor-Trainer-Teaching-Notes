Think of a time when you have been affected by, or noticed someone else
being affected by barriers to accessibility. This may have been at a
conference you attended where the elevator was out of service, or maybe
a class you were taking relied on audio delivery of content. Describe what happened,
how it impacted your (or someone else's) ability to be involved and what could
have been done to provide better accessibility in this case.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
