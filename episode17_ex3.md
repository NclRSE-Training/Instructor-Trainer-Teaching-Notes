1. Split into groups of three.
1. Assign roles, which will rotate: presenter, timekeeper, note-taker.
2. Have each group member teach 3 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using live coding.
For this exercise, your peers will not 'code-along.' Before
you begin, briefly describe what you will be teaching and what has been learned previously. Do not record this exercise.
3. After each person finishes, each group member should share feedback (starting with themselves) using the same 2x2 rubric as yesterday. The
timekeeper should keep feedback discussion to about 1 minute per person; this may leave some time at the end for general
discussion. The note-taker should record feedback in the Etherpad.
4. Trade off roles.
This exercise should take about 25 minutes.
