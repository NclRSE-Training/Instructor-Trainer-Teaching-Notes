If you're teaching a typical Carpentries workshop, then you are
probably not teaching alone! Make
sure that everyone involved in the workshop - instructors,
helpers, organizers - has a chance to introduce themselves at some point.
If you spread out introductions across sections or have people coming and going,
it helps to build in a reminder to create time later on.
