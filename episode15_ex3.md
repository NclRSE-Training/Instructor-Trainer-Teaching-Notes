Many Instructors aim to teach within a local community and do not want to travel. In that case,
you will coordinate with your community to gain access to teaching opportunities through locally organised workshops.
If you want to be presented with opportunities to teach outside your community -- locally or far from home, be sure to join our [Instructors
mailing list][instructors-list]. This is how we recruit Instructors to teach in centrally-organised workshops around the world.
The Carpentries cannot not guarantee
that all Instructors who respond to recruitment calls will be selected, and depending on your area these opportunities may be scarce.
If you want to get started right away, consider organizing
your own workshop or even teaching a single lesson with a few friends. If your friends have not been through Instructor Training,
you will need to set aside some time to help them understand how best to support your efforts.
