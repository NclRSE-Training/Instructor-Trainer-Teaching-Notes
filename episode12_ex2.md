Before we wrap up for the day, take 5 minutes to think over
everything we have covered so far. On a piece of paper, write
down something that captures what you want to remember about
the day. The Trainers will not look at this - it is just for you.
If you do not know where to start, consider
the following list for a starting point:
- draw a concept map, connecting the material
- draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day's concepts
- write an outline of the topics we covered
- write a paragraph or “journal” entry about your experience of the training today
- write down one thing that struck you the most

This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
