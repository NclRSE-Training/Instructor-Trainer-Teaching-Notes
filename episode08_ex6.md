Since we are so used to being praised for our performance, it can be challenging to change the way we praise our learners. Which of these examples
of praise do you think are based on performance, effort, or improvement?
1. That's exactly how you do it -- you haven't gotten it right yet, but you've tried two different strategies to solve that problem. Keep it up!
2. You're getting to be really good at that. See how it pays to keep at it?
3. Wow, you did that perfectly without any help. Have you thought about taking more computing classes?
4. That was a hard problem. You didn't get the right answer, but look at what you learned trying to solve it!
5. Look at that - you're a natural!

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
