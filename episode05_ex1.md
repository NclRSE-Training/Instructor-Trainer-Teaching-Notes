This website implements a short test of working memory:
[memory-test](https://miku.github.io/activememory/])

What was your score? If you are comfortable, share your answer
in the Etherpad.

If you are unable to use this activity, ask your Trainer to implement the analog version of this test.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
