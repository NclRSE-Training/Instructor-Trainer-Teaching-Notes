Formative assessments allow us as instructors to adapt our instruction to our audience.
What options do we have if a majority of the class chooses:
1. mostly one of the wrong answers?
2. mostly the right answer?
3. an even spread among options?
Choose one of the above scenarios and compose a suggested response to it in the Etherpad.
This discussion should take about 5 minutes.

If someone feels it is too slow, they will be a bit bored. If they feel it is too fast, they will never come back to programming.
