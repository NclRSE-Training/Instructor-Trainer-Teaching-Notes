The prep time for this exercise is intentionally short -- the point is to
practice giving and receiving feedback, not to create a perfect presentation.
Imperfect presentations will
give you more to work with!
**Distributed trainings:**
1. Split into groups of three.
2. Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the topic of
the lesson episode you chose before the start of the training course. You will not
be live coding.
3. Get together with your group and have one person teach their segment to the group.
Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person
should be responsible for the timekeeping).
4. After the first person has finished teaching, share feedback. The person who performed
should start by offering feedback on themselves. The timekeeper should help to keep
feedback to about 5 minutes per person to ensure everyone has time to perform and discuss.
5. Rotate roles and repeat steps 3 & 4
5. Return to the main group and briefly summarize the feedback you received in the Etherpad.
Your Trainer will split the group into virtual break-out rooms. Follow the instructions above
but do not record each other. Instead, give each person feedback immediately after they finish their
turn teaching.

**Trainings where trainees are co-located:**
1. Split into groups of three.
2. Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the topic of
the lesson episode you chose before the start of the training course. You will not
be live coding; you can use a whiteboard or other visual aids if available (but
this is not required!).
3. Get together with your group and have each person teach their segment to the group,
while one person records this (video and audio)
using a cell phone or some other handheld device.
Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person
should be responsible for the timekeeping).
3. After the first person finishes,
rotate roles
(they become the videographer,
the audience becomes the instructor,
the person who was recording becomes the audience)
and then rotate roles again.
4. After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching,
watch the videos as a group.
Everyone gives feedback on all three videos,
i.e., people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.
Keep an eye on the time during feedback, especially if your group has more than 3 people,
to be sure to leave time for everyone.
5. After everyone has given feedback on all of the videos,
return to the main group and put everyone's feedback about you into the Etherpad.
This exercise should take about 25 minutes.
