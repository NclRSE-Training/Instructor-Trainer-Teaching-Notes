Select one learning objective from the episode you've used for teaching practice. Copy it into the etherpad
then add numbers below your objective to address the following:
1. Write your learning objective in the Etherpad.
2. Suppose a learner had mastered this objective, and wanted to try something more cognitively challenging on the exact same topic (i.e. **not** a next step in a workflow). Identify an objective they could work towards next.
3. Suppose a learner struggled to meet the specified objective. What might they be missing? Identify one more fundamental thing a learner needs to be able to do in order to be successful in meeting this objective.
This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
