**Think** about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach,
(e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo)
and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.
**Pair** up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of 'short/long time to master' and 'low/high usefulness'.
In the class Etherpad, **share** the task and where it fits on the graph.
As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our 'teach most immediately useful first' approach.

This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
