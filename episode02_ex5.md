Any instructional tool that generates feedback that is used in a formative way can be described as 'formative assessment.'
Based on your previous educational experience (or even this training so far!)
what types of formative assessments do you know about?
Write your answers in the Etherpad; or go around and have each person in the group name one.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
