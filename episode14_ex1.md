In small groups, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures described on this page: <https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html>
Make notes in the Etherpad:
- What points do you think it is most important or helpful for people to remember?
- What questions or points of confusion do you have, or think others might have?
When you are done, report back to the full group about that stage of the process.
This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
