Any useful estimate of time must take into account
**how frequent failures are**
and how much time is lost to them.
For example,
editing a text file seems like a quick task,
but most graphical editors save things to the user's desktop or home directory.
If a novice needs to run shell commands on the files they've edited,
they often fail to navigate to the right directory without help.
You will learn to anticipate these sorts of challenges as you chart your [expert awareness gaps]. As a result, your skill at estimating time to mastery will improve.
If you are new to teaching, try to ask an experienced instructor for feedback before trying out a new exercise.
