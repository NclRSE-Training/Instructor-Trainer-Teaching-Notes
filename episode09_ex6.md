One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to ask people to sign up for workshops in small teams
rather than as individuals when possible.
If an entire lab group comes,
or if attendees are drawn from the same (or closely-related) disciplines,
everyone in the room will know in advance
that they will be with at least a few people they trust,
which increases the chances of them actually coming.
Furthermore,
if people attend a workshop with their labmates, it's more likely they will
work together to implement what they've learned after the workshop has ended.
