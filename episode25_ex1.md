Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire Instructor Training course. Remember:
- Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate. This gets harder for those who come later!
- Trainers should try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). This is also hard, but important!

This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
