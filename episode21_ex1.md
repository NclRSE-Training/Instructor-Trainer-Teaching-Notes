Learners tell us that it is important to them to leave the workshop
with their own machine set up to do real work. We therefore continue
to teach on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows),
even though it would be simpler to require learners to use just one.
We have experimented with virtual machines (VMs) on learners'
computers to reduce installation problems, but those introduce
problems of their own: older or smaller machines simply are not fast
enough, and learners often struggle to switch back and forth between
two different sets of keyboard shortcuts for things like copying and
pasting.
Some instructors use [Virtual Private Servers][vps] (VPS) over [Secure Shell][ssh]
(SSH) or web browser pages instead. This solves the installation
issues, but makes us dependent on host institutions' WiFi (which can be
unreliable), and has the issues mentioned above with things
like keyboard shortcuts.
