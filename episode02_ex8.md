One of the strengths of Carpentries workshops is that we meet learners *where they are*. Carpentries Instructors
strive to help learners
progress from whatever starting point they happen to be at, without making anyone
feel inferior about their current practices or skillsets. We do this in part by teaching relevant and useful skills
building an inclusive learning environment, and continually getting (and paying attention to!) feedback
from learners. We will be talking in more depth about each of these strategies as we go forward in our workshop.
