People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to say:

we're about the computational equivalent of hanging drywall.'

hands on, practical, and useful. This clearly conveys the purpose of our organization: to support computational skill development
among working practitioners who need the right tools and practices to be effective day to day.
