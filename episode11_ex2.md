We will start by observing some examples of teaching and providing some feedback.
Watch this example teaching video as a group
and then give feedback on it.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U>
Put your feedback in the Etherpad.
Organize your feedback along two axes:
positive vs. opportunities for growth (sometimes called 'negative')
and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said).
Note: there is a version of this video with subtitles in both Spanish and English here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxgMVwQamO0>
This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
