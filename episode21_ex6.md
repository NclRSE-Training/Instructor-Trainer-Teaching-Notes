With a partner, imagine that you are planning a workshop together. For this exercise, you may assume
that your workshop has a separate, designated Host.
- How would you prepare to teach a workshop together?
- How would you coordinate with other members of your instructional team (e.g. Host, Helpers)?
- What kinds of things will you do to support each other during the workshop? What won't you do?

Record some notes, and share your thoughts with the group. This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
