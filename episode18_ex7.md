The idea that ten thousand hours of practice will make someone an expert in some field
is widely known,
but reality is much more complex.
Practice is not doing the same thing over and over again:
practice is doing similar but subtly different things,
getting feedback,
and then changing behavior in response to that feedback to get cumulatively better.
Doing the same thing over and over again is much more likely to solidify bad habits than perfect performance.
This is why we emphasize practice and feedback for learners at our workshops and for trainees in our
Instructor Training program.
