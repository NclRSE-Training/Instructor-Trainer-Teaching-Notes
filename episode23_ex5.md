You have made it to the end of your workshop! Everyone is exhausted and their brains are full. You could cover more content... or you could use the last few
minutes in another way.

In the etherpad, write down one thing you could do at the end of a workshop. What is the value of spending time on that thing?
If you have time after writing down your idea, read through the others in the etherpad. If you have another idea that has not been written down yet, add it
to the list.

This exercise will take about 5 minutes.

<summary>Solution</summary>

<ul>
<li>Close and save files. Where can those files be found, and how can learners pick up independently where you left off?</li>
<li>Reflect on learning. This can help learners to solidify key concepts they have learned, making them easier to remember. It may also flush out a few last questions.</li>
<li>Plan next steps. Does the local community have resources to support continued learning?  Do you have advice for how learners might continue on their own? Even if you have no advice, asking learners to take a moment to discuss their own plans can support them in taking a next step sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Collect feedback. Minute cards, one-up-one-down, and making time for Carpentries post-assessment surveys will support your continuing development as an Instructor as well as our continuing development of Carpentries programs. This can also support or complement a reflection activity.</li>
<li>Check with the workshop host to see if they have any closing words or instructions they would like to share.</li>
<li>Celebrate everyone's hard work. Thank your learners for helping each other, for staying motivated and persevering with you! Thank your helpers -- keep a</li>
list of names handy if you might forget them. Enjoy the applause, and give everyone a moment to bask in praise for a job well done.
</ul>
