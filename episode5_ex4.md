Look in the curriculum that you chose to prepare for this workshop and focus on one step or task that learners will be asked to complete.

1. What concepts will learners need to understand and hold in short-term memory in order to complete this task?
1. Draw a concept map connecting these concepts. What relationships do learners need to understand to connect them?
1. How many of these concepts and relationships have been introduced since the previous step or exercise?

With a partner or in small groups, discuss what you have found. Are your learners at risk of cognitive overload at this point in your workshop? Why or why not?

This exercise should take about 15 minutes.
