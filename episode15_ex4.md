With a partner, take turns asking and answering the question: 'I want to organize a workshop! What will I need to do?' One partner should ask about a
self-organised workshop, and the other can ask about a centrally-organised workshop. If you have a third person, they can help out with follow-up questions
or answers as needed.

When you encounter new questions during this process, be sure to write them in the Etherpad.
Leave about 10 minutes for this discussion.
