For this activity, your Trainer will put you in groups, but you may choose whether to work together or independently.
If you work independently, you can still use your group as a resource to ask questions as they emerge.
Go to the workshop template repository: <https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template>

- If you have a GitHub account (or don't mind creating one) and are comfortable doing so,
follow the directions to begin creating a workshop website using your local location and today's date.

- Alternatively, have a look at the video tutorial linked on the instructions page. With any time
remaining, have a look at the websites for upcoming Carpentries workshops on our website: <https://carpentries.org/upcoming_workshops/>

- Add your questions and thoughts on this process to the Etherpad. If you created a workshop website,
add the link there as well.
This exercise should take about 15 minutes.


Note: Sometimes web browsers will cache the workshop webpage, so when
you make changes in GitHub, they do not show up on the workshop webpage
immediately. Two ways to avoid this are to use a 'private' or
'incognito' mode in your web browser or by following these
instructions to bypass your browser cache: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache>.
