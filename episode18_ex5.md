How might you apply formative assessment to:
a) verify that that achievement has been met by all and
b) make learners aware of their accomplishment?
Keep in mind that formative assessment can take many forms, including multiple
choice questions, other exercises, spontaneous questions and calls for sticky
notes. Write some notes or thoughts about this process in the Etherpad for
discussion.
This exercise and discussion should take about 10 minutes.
