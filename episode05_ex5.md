An alternative to guided practice is a *minimal guidance* approach, where
learners are given raw materials (for example a text or reference) and
asked to explore and learn to solve problems on their own.
Minimal guidance is commonly found in many instructional strategies you may have encountered,
variously known as *constructivist*, *discovery*, *problem-based*, *experiential*
or *inquiry-based* learning.
These strategies are not without merit! Indeed, they can work exceptionally well with advanced learners.
However, they frequently fall flat, especially with novice audiences.
A landmark paper by [Kirshner et al.][kirschner-paper]
responds to the popularity and uneven success of minimal guidance, applying
cognitive load theory to understand why these strategies often fail.
Some people feel concerned that guided practice amounts to 'hand-holding,'
implying that learners who receive support may never learn
to function independently. This view fails to account for the *additional cognitive
load* experienced by novices creating new connections while learning a task.
**Minimally-guided instruction requires learners to simultaneously
master a domain's factual content
AND its search and problem-solving strategies.** Fostering creativity and independence takes time.
Minimal guidance is intuitively appealing,
but that does not mean it always works.
