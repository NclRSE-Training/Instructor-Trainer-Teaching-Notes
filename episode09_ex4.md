Looking at people who work with disability and accessibility, it's
easy to be overwhelmed by all the different ways we could make
instruction more accessible.
- *It is ok not to do everything at once*. We do not ask learners in our workshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in one go,
but instead to add things gradually at a rate they can manage.
Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when preparing for workshops
through reflective practice, adding something new each time.
- *Do the easy things first.*
There are plenty of ways to make workshops more accessible
that are both quick to accomplish and minimal in demands on attention:
font choices, text size,
checking in advance that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp, etc.
