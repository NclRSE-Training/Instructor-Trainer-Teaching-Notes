Consider some of the teaching tools and strategies we have discussed so far in this workshop, or others you have observed in your experience.
How do these meet UDL goals of providing multiple options for learners?

Consider multiple ways for learners to:
- receive information
- engage with you, the material, and other learners
- share what they have learned

This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
