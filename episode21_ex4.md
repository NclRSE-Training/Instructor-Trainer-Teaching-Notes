1) Take 5 minutes to read through the Code of Conduct Incident Response Guidelines: <https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html>

2) Discuss what you have read in small groups. As questions arise, you may wish to refer to our complete Code of Conduct section in The Carpentries Handbook:
<https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html> or to the Transparency Reports released by The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee: <https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/code-of-conduct-transparency-reports>
- What kinds of things could your instructional team agree upon in advance of your workshop?
- What questions do you have about CoC enforcement?

3) Write some notes in the Etherpad.
This discussion should take about 10 minutes.
