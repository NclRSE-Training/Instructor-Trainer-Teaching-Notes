In The Carpentries, we aim to create an inclusive environment. We prefer to refer to this
phenomenon as the *expert awareness gap* to be consistent with our objective to use
inclusive language. It can be exclusionary to use a term that relates to a disability
for other purposes. We introduce both terms, however, to help you as future
instructors engage with these ideas in
the literature and with people outside of The Carpentries community.
In evaluating potential terms, one instructor provided the following thoughts:
I like expert awareness gap because it is more precise than blind spot
(it is not about seeing, but about noticing) and feels more of a surmountable
challenge than a disadvantage. To me a disadvantage can sometimes feel like
thing that exists as a fact, like an inevitable consequence, but a gap is a
thing to be bridged-- and we certainly want instructors to try to overcome
(or mitigate) their expert awareness gap
