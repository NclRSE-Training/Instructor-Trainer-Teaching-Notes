Several research studies (in [2007][fincher-warren], [2012][fincher-stories], and [2015][barker-practice]) have shown
that teachers do not adopt instructional practices based on reports about the effectiveness of those practices.
Social norms, institutional
culture, and lack of time and support prevent many teachers from moving out of
their accustomed teaching habits. Change in teaching does not come about through reading about new teaching practices, but by seeing
these practices in action, practicing them and getting feedback from other instructors.
