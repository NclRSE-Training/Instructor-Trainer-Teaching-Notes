A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they've made an error
that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between
`ls` and the name of the directory they are looking at). What would you say to the learner?
In the Etherpad, describe the error your learner has made and how you would respond.
This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
