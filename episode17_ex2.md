Watch this first participatory live coding demo video: [https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE][live-coding-bad]
and this second demo video: [https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY][live-coding-good]
as a group and then summarize your feedback on both in the Etherpad.
Use the 2x2 rubric for feedback we discussed earlier.
In the videos, the bash shell `for` loop is taught,
and it is assumed learners are familiar with how to use a variable,
the `head` command and the content of the `basilisk.dat unicorn.dat`

Note: Sometime sounds in the room can be poor. Turning on closed captioning by pressing the cc button will improve the accessibility of these videos.
