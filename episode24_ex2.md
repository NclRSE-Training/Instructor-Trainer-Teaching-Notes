Use a concept map or other visual organiser of your choice to connect some of
the concepts above. You don't have to use them all! How are the terms you have
chosen to include related to each other?
Work on this on your own. There is no 'right answer' -- this is about you building
up a mental model, moving from 'novice' to 'competent practitioner'.
If you feel you have finished organizing your thoughts, try the next exercise.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
